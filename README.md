# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📊 Project Overview

**COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** is a data analysis project that visualizes and compares COVID-19 trends worldwide. Using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), the project explores confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and over time.

This project helps uncover meaningful patterns through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and compelling visualizations using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.

## 🚩 Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- ✅ Analyze time trends: cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- ✅ Compare metrics across countries and regions
- ✅ Visualize trends using charts and optional maps
- ✅ Communicate insights with narrative reporting in a Jupyter Notebook
